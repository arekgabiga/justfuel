## Project Description

JustFuel is a minimalist web application designed to simplify manual tracking of fuel consumption and costs. It provides an intuitive interface for logging refuels, managing multiple vehicles, and visualizing key statisticsâ€”without unnecessary complexity.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro 5 with React 19 components
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind 4 & Shadcn/ui
- **State & Utilities**: clsx, class-variance-authority, lucide-react, tailwind-merge
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, SDK)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean (Docker)

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22.14.0](https://nodejs.org/) (managed via NVM)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (bundled with Node.js)
- A Supabase project with API URL and Anon Key

### Setup

```bash
# Use the Node version defined in .nvmrc
nvm install
nvm use

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/justfuel.git
cd justfuel

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file with the following variables:
# SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
# SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app.

### Development Auth Fallback (optional)

During early development you can bypass Bearer auth for server endpoints by enabling a fallback user.

Add the following to your `.env` to enable the fallback:

```bash
DEV_AUTH_FALLBACK=true
```

Behavior when enabled:

- If an incoming request lacks a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, the backend will scope queries to the development user id defined as `DEFAULT_USER_ID` in `src/db/supabase.client.ts`.
- When a valid Bearer token is present, normal RLS-based auth is used.

Endpoint example (dev fallback enabled, no token):

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/cars"
```

Endpoint example (production-like):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/cars"
```

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- **User Account Management**: register, login, logout.
- **Vehicle Management (CRUD)**: add, list, edit, delete vehicles (with confirmation).
- **Fuel Entry Management (CRUD)**:
  - Log refuels with date, volume, cost, odometer or distance.
  - Infinite scroll grid of entries, color-coded consumption.
  - Edit/delete entries with auto-recalculation of stats.
- **Statistics & Visualizations**:
  - Compute L/100km, cost per liter, distance between refuels.
  - Color-coded fuel consumption based on deviation from average.
  - Three charts: consumption over time, price per liter, distance per refuel.
- **Onboarding**: guide new users to add first vehicle and refuel entry.

### Out of Scope

- Data export (CSV/PDF).
- Social features or data sharing.
- Native mobile apps (iOS/Android).
- In-app feedback collection.
- Automatic GPS/OBD-II integrations.

## Project Status

This project is currently in **MVP development**. Core features are implemented; UI and UX improvements, testing, and documentation are ongoing.

## Logging and Diagnostics

- Correlate requests using `x-request-id` header. If present, include it in all server logs for the request lifecycle (e.g., `console.error("[GET /api/cars/{carId}] requestId=...", err)`).
- Log only non-sensitive context. Avoid PII such as raw Authorization headers, tokens, or user emails. Prefer IDs and counts.
- Favor structured messages that include: route, requestId, outcome (success/error), and brief reason on error.
- On validation failures (Zod), include parser message in `details.issues` of `ErrorResponseDTO`; avoid logging user-provided payloads.
- For upstream errors (e.g., Supabase failures), log the error object and return `INTERNAL_ERROR` with a generic message.
- In development, surface stack traces in the console; in production, keep responses minimal and leverage external log collectors if needed.
